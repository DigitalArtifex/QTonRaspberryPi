This is a fork of QTonRaspberryPi that has been setup for my project needs. It is a more complete set of the Qt SDK and reorganizing of image names and purposes. It takes 2-4+ hours to build from fresh install

If you want to use it, I would recommend using the original as a base and editing it to your needs by visiting the original project's github page https://github.com/PhysicsX/QTonRaspberryPi/
